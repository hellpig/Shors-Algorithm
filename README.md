# Shors-Algorithm
Use NumPy instead of Qiskit to simulate a quantum computer that performs Shor's algorithm on any suitable integer.

Each Python file is standalone. See the comments at the top of each file!
* shor.py: simulates the quantum computer
* shorScan.py: classically finds cycle lengths of various N's (and a's) instead of using Shor's algorithm
* shorModCircuit.py: for trying to figure out quantum circuits to do a%N math
